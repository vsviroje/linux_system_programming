Soon afterward, I got a job at Digital Equipment Corporation (UK), and soon moved into their training branch, where I was the founding member of what soon became a small group of ULTRIX trainers. I specialized in system programming training, and traveled quite a bit around Europe running system programming courses for Digital employees and customers.
