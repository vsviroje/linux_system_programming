A return to New Zealand, a second degree (Psychology plus a good measure of Art History, which gave me a lot more practice writing), and a short spell working on MS Windows applications took me away from UNIX for a few years. I first got interested in Linux when I picked up some Slackware CDs in the mid-1990s, but didn't do any serious work again with it until the late 1990s, when I moved to Munich, where my first job was at a company whose infrastructure was entirely Linux-based. Since then, all of my day jobs have employed Linux.
